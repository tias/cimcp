== CIMCP 2.7, 2011-11-12 ==
    First official release with the new build system

    + Now automatically downloads and compiles Gecode (or point it to an existing install)
    + configures our code with the same parameters
    + Some changes to make the code work under windows
    + Compatible with gecode 3.7.1 (and lower, and probably higher too)

== CIMCP 2.1, 2009-12-17 ==
    Release with Mac support, minor changes
    + Tested on Mac: needed -lgecodesupport in the Makefile
    + Support for gecode 3.2.2
        - should be slightly more efficient because of better propagator for linear sum of booleans
    + New print option: --print full, prints items and transactions
    + Some cleanups in the common/ files

== CIMCP 2.0, 2009-07-12 ==
